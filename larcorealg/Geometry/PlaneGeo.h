  /**
   * @brief Geometry information for a single wire plane.
   * @ingroup Geometry
   *
   * The plane is represented in the geometry by a solid which contains wires.
   * Currently, only box solids are well supported.
   * The box which is representation of the plane has some thickness, and it
   * should not be assumed that the wires are in the median section of it,
   * that is, the center of the box may not lie on the plane defined by the
   * wires.
   *
   * The plane defines two local reference frames.
   * The first, depending on wire directions and therefore called "wire base",
   * is defined by the normal to the plane (pointing toward the center of the
   * TPC), the direction of the wires, and the direction that the wires measure.
   * This is a positive orthogonal base.
   * Note that for this base to be correctly defined, the Geometry service has
   * to provide external information (for example, where the center of the
   * TPC is).
   *
   * The second, depending only on the shape of the plane and called "frame
   * base", is defined by the normal (the same as for the previous one), and two
   * orthogonal axes, "width" and "depth", aligned with the sides of the plane.
   * If the plane has not the shape of a box, this reference frame is not
   * available. This coordinate system is also positive defined.
   * These components are all measured in centimeters.
   *
